        <h1>The Hills Are Alive </h1>
        <h4> by Richard Rodgers </h4>
        
                <pre>
    [CHILDREN]
    The hills are alive
    With the sound of music
    With songs they have sung
    For a thousand years

    The hills fill my heart
    With the sound of music
    My heart wants to sing
    Every song it hears (Every song that it hears)

    My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds that rise
    From the lake to the trees (To the trees)
    My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
    From a church on a breeze

    To laugh like a brook
    When it trips and falls over stones on its way (On its way)
    To sing through the night
    Like a lark who is learning to pray

    [CAPTAIN VON TRAPP]
    I go to the hills
    When my heart is lonely
    I know I will hear
    What I've heard before

    My heart will be blessed
    With the sound of music
    And I'll

    [CAPTAIN VON TRAPP & CHILDREN]
    Sing once more
